# sqlalchemy-challenge

This challenge involves looking at temperature and precipitation data from weather stations in Hawaii. Using sqlalchemy, pandas, matplotlib, and flask, we are creating visualizations and callable API to determine various characteristics regarding weather.

One interesting concept employed was iterating over the "inspect" method using vars() to create classes for the tables in the sqlite database (using .title() to ensure the list is in title case, as is convention when identifying a class).

Data for step 1 and the step 1 jupyter notebook can be found in Step_1_Climate_Analysis_And_Exploration.

The app.py, bonus 1 and bonus 2 notebooks can be found in the main directory.
